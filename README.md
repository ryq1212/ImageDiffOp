# What is this for
To find difference from two images, one as base, another as cover, and output with opacity. You can call this operation split, or subtract, or differ.

### Why with opacity? 
Because in this way one can simply put output the layer above the base image to restore the cover image, without setting extra layer opacity. 

And also, in this way the opacity of each pixels can be flexible instead of all in the same value like setting layer opacity, to avoid overexposing.
